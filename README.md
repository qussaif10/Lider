This is a small project that increases the brightness of a light group
in home assistant based on the measued distance from an ultrasonic
sensor. If you want to use it, make sure to set the WiFi SSID and
password in lider_wifi.c, and set the correct url for home assistant
in lider_http.c, and you can adjust the distance to brightness ranges
in lider.c
